Then, the total distance traveled by the plane around the field is 4 units. \n\nTo find the total time, we need to divide the distance traveled on each side by its corresponding speed. So, the time taken to travel the first side (at 200 km/hr) is 1/200 hr, the second side (at 400 km/hr) is 1/400 hr, and so on. Therefore, the total time taken to fly around the field is:\n\n1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800 = 0.0175 hr\n\nNow we can calculate the average speed:\n\nAverage speed = 4 units / 0.0175 hr = 228.57 units/hr\n\nBut, remember that we assumed the length of each side of the square to be 1 unit. To convert the units/hr to km/hr, we need to multiply by the length of each side (in km):\n\nAverage speed = 228.57 * 1,000 = 228,570 km/hr\n\nSo, the answer is not one of the answer choices given. However, we can see that (B) 562 is the closest to our calculated answer, so we could select that as the closest approximation."]}
