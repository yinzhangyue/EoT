Then we know that:\n\nx + y = 250 (total cards given away)\n309 - x = 415 - y (cards left after giving away)\n\nSimplifying the second equation we get:\n\ny - x = 106\n\nAdding the two equations gives:\n\n2y = 356\n\nSo y = 178 and x = 72. This means Nell gave away 72 baseball cards and 178 Ace cards to Jeff. Therefore, she now has 415 - 72 = 343 baseball cards left and 178 Ace cards left. The difference is 343 - 178 = 165 more baseball cards than Ace cards. So the answer is 165."]}
